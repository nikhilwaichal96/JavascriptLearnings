# For in loop
The for...in loop over the enumerable properties that are keyed by strings of an object.

- When you loop over the properties of an object that inherits from another object, the for...in statement goes up in the prototype chain and enumerates inherited properties.
- To prevent enumeration of in herited property we can use hasOwnProperty() method
- Itâ€™s good practice to not use the for...in to iterate over an array, especially when the order of the array elements is important.
-  someone may set a property of the built-in Array type in their libraries as follows
-  We should n't use for in loop with array because it inherit properties and order is inconsistent when element is undefined it is ignored by for in loop
-  While working with arrays we should use Traditional loop or forEach,map,reduce function
-  The order in which for...in loop iterates over the properties of an object is not guaranteed to be consistent across different JavaScript engines or versions. If you need to guarantee a specific order, you should consider using Object.keys(), Object.values(), or Object.entries() to get an array of keys/values/entries and then iterate over that array using a loop.

```javascript
var person = {
    firstPerson: {
        firstName: 'John',
        lastName: 'Doe',
        ssn: '299-24-2351'
    },
    secondPerson: {
        firstName: 'John',
        lastName: 'Doe',
        ssn: '299-24-2351'
    }

};

for (var prop in person.firstPerson) {
    console.log(prop + ':' + person.firstPerson[prop]);
}


//Inherit properties 
var decoration = {
    color: 'red'
};

var circle = Object.create(decoration);
circle.radius = 10;


for(const prop in circle) {
    console.log("Printing key properties inherited "+prop); //print color,radius
}

//if we just want to iterate on obj properties then we need to use hasOwnProperty()

for(const prop in circle) {
    if(circle.hasOwnProperty(prop)) {
        console.log("Just printing properties of obj not prototype inherited keys "+prop); //radius
    }
}

//Why we shouldn't use for in loop with arrays

//It inherits property from Arrays.prototype
Array.prototype.foo = 100;  //set property in builtin array 

const items = [10, 20, 30]; 
let total = 0;

for (var prop in items) {
  console.log({ prop, value: items[prop] });// prop foo gets inherited
  total += items[prop];
}
console.log(total); // 160 property is getting inherited

//Order is not preserved by for in loop example:-
var arr = [];
// set the third element to 3, other elements are `undefined`
arr[2] = 3; 
console.log("with traditional loop")
for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    console.log(arr[i]);    //print undefined undefined 3
}

console.log("with for in loop")
for (const key in arr) {
    console.log(arr[key]); // print 3 for in loop ignores undefined
}
```
